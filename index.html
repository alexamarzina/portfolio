           <h1>The End</h1>
        	<div class="cool1">
        	<h3>Data</h3>
 				<p>For both synthesis projects, I used the
 				<a href="https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/">
 				Million Song Dataset</a>. Specifically, for
 				<a href="https://alexamarzina.github.io/synthesis-2-revision/data-representation/">
 				synthesis 2</a>, I took the data, made it into
 				lists, then grouped it in a way that I 
 				was able to see the amount of the word
 				"love" in song titles for years 1930-2010.</p>
 				<br>
 				</p>While it's a cool representation, it
 				totally leaves out the individual titles of
 				the songs, which would be cool to look at and
 				compare how each one uses "love," for example.
 				</p>
 				<br>
 				<p>When this class started, I had no idea
 				what data I wanted to use — or even the
 				importance of raw data, really — so I don't
 				think I particularly wish that I did
 				anything differently. This data was cool and
 				I'm happy with what I was able to produce with
 				it.</p>
 				<br><br>
 			<h3>Visualization Choice</h3>
 				<p>When I originally couldn't get the line
 				graph to work for synthesis 2, I was thinking
 				of trying to do a bar graph instead. That
 				way, it would still show the amount of
 				"love"s in songs by year. However, I didn't
 				think it would be able to show the progression
 				over time as well as a line graph, so I
 				worked really hard to make it work the way
 				I wanted it to, and I think the visualization
 				was successful in that way.</p>
 				<br><br>
 			<h3>Design Choice</h3>
 				<p>I got some (well-deserved) flack for my
 				color scheme choice for my <a href="https://alexamarzina.github.io/skills/">
 				skills development assignment</a>. However,
 				I didn't choose these colors for no reason.
 				Since this assignment was all about our
 				learning and personal growth, and was all
 				personal, basically, I thought it would
 				make the most sense to design the site in
 				variations of my favorite color: pink. I think
 				it looks cute, and it's <b>my</b> growth/learning
 				that was documented on this site, so I went with
 				it.</p>
 				<br>
 				<p>I know it doesn't make sense to make
 				every project in my favorite color, but I
 				think there is a time and a place! So, for the
 				<a href="https://alexamarzina.github.io/synthesis-2-revision/artist-statement/">
 				revision of synthesis 2</a>, I used an online
 				tool called <a href="https://coolors.co/">
 				"Coolors"</a> to help me choose a cohesive
 				set of colors. I didn't want to pick something
 				that was <b>too</b> neutral and boring, because
 				that's not who I am as a person, plus music
 				data and titles isn't super serious data. I
 				wanted this to be kind of playful. I don't think
 				it's too bright, but you are free to disagree.</p>
 				<br>
 				<p>If I was presenting this to a music expert,
 				if those exist or need specific qualifications,
 				I'm not sure if I would change the colors or not.
 				I think bright colors put people in a good mood,
 				so I wouldn't want to make it more dull or muted,
 				especially since musicians tend to be more creative
 				and would probably appreciate my "wacky" colors.</p>
 				<br>
 				<p>Someone like a business man, for example, who
 				probably doesn't know much about the technicalities of
 				music, still probably listens to the radio — at least —
 				on his way home from work and hears the pop music and
 				the love songs and every thing in between and can still
 				probably see the data in the same way despite the site
 				being a little bit bright. That being said, I stand by
 				my color choices!</p>
