        	<h3>Data</h3>
 				<p>For both synthesis projects, I used the
 				<a href="https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/">
 				Million Song Dataset</a>. Specifically, for
 				<a href="https://alexamarzina.github.io/synthesis-2-revision/data-representation/">
 				synthesis 2</a>, I took the data, made it into
 				lists, then grouped it in a way that I 
 				was able to see the amount of the word
 				"love" in song titles for years 1930-2010.</p>
 				<br>
 				</p>While it's a cool representation, it
 				totally leaves out the individual titles of
 				the songs, which would be cool to look at and
 				compare how each one uses "love," for example.
 				</p>
 				<br>
 				<p>When this class started, I had no idea
 				what data I wanted to use — or even the
 				importance of raw data, really — so I don't
 				think I particularly wish that I did
 				anything differently. This data was cool and
 				I'm happy with what I was able to produce with
 				it.</p>
 				<br><br>
 			<h3>Visualization Choice</h3>
 				<p>When I originally couldn't get the line
 				graph to work for synthesis 2, I was thinking
 				of trying to do a bar graph instead. That
 				way, it would still show the amount of
 				"love"s in songs by year. However, I didn't
 				think it would be able to show the progression
 				over time as well as a line graph, so I
 				worked really hard to make it work the way
 				I wanted it to, and I think the visualization
 				was successful in that way.</p>
